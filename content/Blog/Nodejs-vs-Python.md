# Javascript Functions
Javascript was famously created in 10 days (or so the myth goes). The reason this haste was needed was because Netscape (the creators of Javascript) were in the middle of the (browser wars)[] with Microsoft. Both companies desired a light weight alternative to Java Applets (gold star to people who remember those), and Netscape needed to move quickly if it was to beat Microsoft in creating a standard. Unfortunately, haste created some serious flaws in the Javascript language, and in hindsight, these flaws are due to the language not being thought out that thouroughly.
