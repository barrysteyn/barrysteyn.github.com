>> **Doctrina** - teaching, instruction, learning (Latin)

Life is only interesting if one never stops learning. This blog is a testament to this fact, and I will post whatever I find interesting here.
 
My formal education is in Math and Computer Science, but all I have ever wanted to do since I can remember is build things. Not anything mind you, but things that matter, that positively affect people. That's why I am so attracted to computer science: I love building programs. I also love the building process that is inherent with entrepreneurism.

Some of my interests are:

* [Cryptography](http://doctrina.org/tag/cryptography.html)
* Excercise
* [Math](http://doctrina.org/tag/math.html)
* Mountaineering
* [Programming](http://doctrina.org/tag/development.html)
* Rock Climbing
* Running
* Traveling
