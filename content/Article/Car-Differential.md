# A Car Differential
When turning a corner, one wheel must necessarily turn faster than the other
wheel. This is achieved by each wheel being independent to the other wheel. Both
wheels are able to work together in harmony by being connected to the
[differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)).
This video explains how it works.
