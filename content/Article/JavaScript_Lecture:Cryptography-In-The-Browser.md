Title: JavaScript Lecture: Cryptography In The Browser
Tags: JavaScript, Cryptography, Lecture
Slug: JavaScript_Lecture:Cryptography_In_The_Browser

I was recently asked to lecture the local Toronto JavaScript meetup about Cryptography in the browser. Here are my lecture slides. Apparently, there is a video of my talk that will be put up. When I get, I will link to it over here.

Enjoy, and I would grateful for any feedback. Do note that the audience was not hard-core cryptographers.
